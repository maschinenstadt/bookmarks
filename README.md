# My exported bookmarks
## Remark
At the moment one half is (somehow) sorted, the other half is a total chaos.
But all of them are "high quality" links, promised!

I'll sort all of them later. And I'll bring 'em to a cms bookmark module. ..

## Usage
Use your browser's "**bookmark manager**" and '__Import__' this '**bookmarks.html**'.
