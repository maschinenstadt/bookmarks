# Bookmarks

This site at <github.com> is linked on my (tiny) private Homepage. Visit it! :-D

## Description

Hey ho everyone!

This is my collection of bookmarks, which I've collected in the course of time.
Some are sorted by topic etc., some are still unsorted, thrown in. ..

But they've got one thing in common: they are *high quality*! So I've decided to
collect them .. but the main reason for this decision was: I decided to read all
of them later, when I've got more time! .. some are still unread, some are already
new neural association in my brain.

I wish you as much fun as I had reading this nice stuff. _At least_ as much as I! ;-)

## Usage (Browser)

The "bookmarks.html" is exported via browser - thus it can be imported again (by you).
Some tiny "how to" can be found on a (sub) site of my homepage:
